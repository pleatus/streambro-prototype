# streambro-prototype
streamBro is a project codename for dynamic remote controlled web-based overlays.

I was inspired to create the streamBro after streaming myself playing games on Twitch. There were some simple tools I would have liked to use which other overlay platforms (like Streamlabs) did not offer.

Realizing the need for basic overlay tools, and an asynchronous multi-platform system to remotely control them, I began developing the streamBro.

This application also features integration using the Twitch API. On first run the user will have the option of authorizing streamBro to access their Twitch account.
